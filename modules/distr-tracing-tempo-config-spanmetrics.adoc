= Configure monitor tab in Jaeger UI

Trace data contains rich information and most importantly the data is normalized across instrumented languages and frameworks.
Therefore, additional metrics can be extracted from traces. These metrics are request count, duration and error count (RED).
The metrics can be visualized in Jaeger console in the Monitor tab.

The metrics are derived from spans in the OpenTelemetry collector, then scraped from the collector by the Prometheus deployed in the user-workload monitoring stack.
Jaeger UI queries these metrics from the Prometheus endpoint and visualizes.

== OpenTelemetry collector configuration

The OpenTelemetry collector needs to configure `spanmetrics` connector which derives metrics from traces and exports the metrics in the Prometheus format.

.OpenTelemetry collector CR for span RED

kind: OpenTelemetryCollector

        metrics:
          receivers: [spanmetrics] <5>
          exporters: [prometheus]
----
<1> Spanmetrics connector receives traces and exports metrics.
<2> OTLP receiver to receive spans in the OpenTelemetry protocol.
<3> Prometheus exporter is used to export metrics in the Prometheus format.
<4> Spanmetrics connector is configured as exporter in traces pipeline.
<5> Spanmetrics connector is configured as receiver in metrics pipeline.

// TODO Max please fix this appropriately
The setup as well requires to configure the user-workload monitoring stack to scrape the Prometheus endpoint of the collector - https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/60953/files#diff-bd0dc510dd646c60e63a7daf0b9d22eb7525adc8467753a6bdb37948345992ddR7

== Tempo configuration

The `TempoStack` CR needs to enable the monitor tab and set the Prometheus endpoint to Thanos querier service to query the data from the user-defined monitoring stack.

.TempoStack CR with enabled monitor tab
[source,yaml]
----
kind:  TempoStack
apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: simplest
spec:
  template:
    gateway:
      enabled: false <1>
    queryFrontend:
      jaegerQuery:

          enabled: true <2>
          prometheusEndpoint: https://thanos-querier.openshift-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9091 <3>
        ingress:
          type: route
----
<1> Gateway is enabled because the monitor tab is not supported thorough the gateway deployment.
<2> Enables monitoring tab in Jaeger console.
<3> The Thanos querier service name from user-workload monitoring.
